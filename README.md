**PROJECT TITLE**

Prediction of "iris.csv" dataset for DecisionTree algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

An American based botanical garden grows iris flower in thier labs,but using biotechnology in a single tree different types of variety of flowers are grown.As a Datascience Engineer find out accuracy of all categories of flowers contain same species.
